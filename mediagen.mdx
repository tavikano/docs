## Getting Started Privately

### Initial Setup

1. Type `/model` to pick a model that suits your needs
2. Enter the newly created **private** active Thread (If no System Prompt was entered previously, the thread name will be a numerical string)
3. Type `/` to access media generation models and help commands:
   - `text-to-video`
   - `text-to-image`
   - `image-to-text`
4. Prompt the model with your request

### Understanding Private Threads

- **Private** thread creation messages are ephemeral (only visible to the user creating the ModelChat thread)
- Your active threads can be found by checking **⁠model-chat**
- The channel menu will show a blinking dot as **⁠model-chat** threads are private by default
- Access channel names under active threads via right-click (context menu)
- Additional users must be invited using the @ symbol once the model loads in the channel

### System Prompts

Select System Prompt for `text/vision` models and type the `system_prompt` to define the model's purpose and/or Role. This action will name the thread. *Optional*

### Media Generation Guidelines

#### Image and Video Input

We currently support the following multimodal models: Nova Lite/Pro, Reels & Canvas, Claude Sonnet, Haiku 3 & Llama 11b/90b

#### Image and Video Input

- For Nova Lite/Pro (video-to-text):
    - First, upload the video
    - Provide a brief description of the video content on the prompt
    - Prompt the model with the desired output

- For Reels (text-to-video):
    - Use `/text-to-video` to generate 6 seconds of video
    - Use `/image-to-video` to convert images to videos
    * Videos might take 5-6 minutes to generate

- For Canvas (text-to-image):
    - Use `/text-to-image` to generate images from text descriptions
    * Depending on the amount of Images, generations might take 1-2 minutes to generate

- For Claude and Llama (multimodal vision models):
    - First, upload the image
    - Provide a brief description of the image content on the prompt
    - Prompt the model with the desired output

#### Character Limits

- Image generation: Maximum 1024 characters
- Video generation: Maximum 512 characters

#### Model-Specific Notes

- For video understanding, use Nova Lite or Nova Pro Models
- For media generation workflows, we recommend pre-prompting a multimodal model (Claude, Llama) with image or text context

### Important Notes

- Mediagen processes requests in an orderly queue
- Reference help commands under `/` commands for detailed guidance
