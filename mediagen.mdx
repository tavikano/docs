## Getting Started Privately

### Initial Setup

1. Type `/model` to pick a model that suits your needs
2. Enter the newly created **private** active Thread (If no System Prompt was entered previously, the thread name will be a numerical string)
3. Type `/` to access media generation models and help commands:
   - `text-to-video`
   - `text-to-image`
   - `image-to-text`
4. Prompt the model with your request

### Understanding Private Threads

- **Private** thread creation messages are ephemeral (only visible to the user creating the ModelChat thread)
- Your active threads can be found by checking **⁠model-chat**
- The channel menu will show a blinking dot as **⁠model-chat** threads are private by default
- Access channel names under active threads via right-click (context menu)
- Additional users must be invited using the @ symbol once the model loads in the channel

### System Prompts

Select System Prompt for `text/vision` models and type the `system_prompt` to define the model's purpose and/or Role. This action will name the thread. *Optional*

### Media Generation Guidelines

#### Image and Video Input

- For Image-to-Video and Vision Models (Nova Lite/Pro, Reels & Canvas, Claude Sonnet, Haiku 3 & Llama 11b/90b):
  - Upload video or image first, then prompt
  - For image-to-video, use exactly 1280x720 dimension
  - Use non-transparent/flat JPEG or PNG files, preferably compressed

#### Character Limits

- Image generation: Maximum 1024 characters
- Video generation: Maximum 512 characters

#### Model-Specific Notes

- For video understanding, use Nova Lite or Nova Pro Models
- For media generation workflows, we recommend pre-prompting a multimodal model (Claude, Llama) with image or text context

### Important Notes

- Models process requests in an orderly queue
- Reference help commands under `/` commands for detailed guidance
