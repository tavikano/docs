# MediaGen Guide

## Quick Start

### Basic Setup
1. Use `/model` to select your preferred model
2. Enter your private thread (auto-named with a numerical string)
3. Access media commands with `/`:
```bash
/text_to_video    # Generate videos from text
/text_to_image    # Create images from descriptions
/image_to_text    # Convert images to text descriptions
```

## Available Models

### Multimodal Support
* **Video Processing**: Nova Lite/Pro
* **Video Generation**: Reels/Ray2
* **Image Generation**: Canvas
* **Vision Models**: Claude Sonnet, Haiku 3, Llama 11b/90b

## Working with Media

### Video Generation (Reels)
```bash
/text_to_video    # Generate 5-9-second videos
/image_to_video   # Convert static images to videos
```
* Processing time: 5-6 minutes
* Character limit: 512 characters(reels) / 1,024 characters(ray2)

### Image Generation (Canvas)
```bash
/text_to_image    # Create images from descriptions
```
* Processing time: 1-2 minutes
* Character limit: 1,024 characters

### Video Understanding (Nova)
1. Upload your video
2. Provide content description
3. Specify desired output
4. Submit for processing

### Vision Models (Claude/Llama)
1. Upload your image
2. Add content description
3. Specify analysis requirements
4. Wait for model response

## Thread Management

### Private Threads
* Messages are ephemeral (visible only to creator)
* Access threads via **#model-chat**
* Look for blinking dot in channel menu
* Right-click to view channel names
* Invite others using @ mentions

### System Prompts
* Optional thread naming feature
* Defines model purpose/role
* Available for text/vision models
* Set via `system_prompt` parameter

## Best Practices

### Workflow Optimization
* Use multimodal models for context preparation
* Pre-prompt with image or text context
* Consider model-specific strengths
* Mind character limits for each type

### Queue Management
* Requests processed in order
* Include cooldown periods
* Check queue status before submitting
* Use help commands for guidance

## Support Options

### Getting Help
* Direct message `@StreamPod AI`
* Visit `#general-support` channel
* Use `/` commands for help documentation
* Check model-specific guidelines

### Common Solutions
* Respect character limits
* Allow sufficient processing time
* Use appropriate models for tasks
* Follow upload-then-prompt sequence

## Advanced Tips

### Model Selection
* Choose based on media type
* Consider processing time needs
* Review character limitations
* Check multimodal capabilities

### Content Guidelines
* Provide clear descriptions
* Include relevant context
