## Pods - WIP

## Getting Started

Pods are a set of agentic workflows triggered by using the `/pod` command within Discord. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Join a Discord Server**: Ensure you are a member of a Discord server where the bot is installed.
2. **Use the `/pod` Command**: In any text channel, type `/pod` followed by the specific workflow you want to trigger. For example, `/pod start` to initiate a workflow.
3. **Follow Prompts**: The bot will guide you through the necessary steps to complete the workflow. Follow the prompts and provide any required information.
4. **Complete the Workflow**: Once all steps are completed, the bot will confirm the successful execution of the workflow.

For more detailed information on available workflows and their specific commands, refer to the [Pods Documentation](#).
