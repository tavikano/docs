# StreamPod Quickstart Guide

## Overview

StreamPod provides a powerful interface for interacting with various AI models through Discord. This guide will help you get started with text, image, and video generation capabilities.

## Features

- **Diverse Models**: Access multiple AI models optimized for different tasks and use cases
- **Multimodal Support**: Seamlessly combine text, images, and video in your interactions
- **Private Threads**: Secure, personalized conversations with AI models
- **Media Generation**: Create images, videos, and sound effects from text descriptions

## Getting Started

### Creating a Private Chat

1. Navigate to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1245569640265023572/1311515052385239061"> `#⁠model-chat`</a> channel
2. Type `/model` to select your preferred AI model
3. Enter the newly created private thread
   - Thread names are named numerically by default unless a system prompt is specified
   - Only you can see the thread creation message
   - Additional users must be invited using the @ symbol

### Basic Commands

#### Text Generation
- Use `/model` to access text-based models
- Optionally set a system prompt to define the model's behavior

#### Media Generation
- `/text-to-image`: Generate images from text descriptions
- `/text-to-video`: Create videos from text prompts
- `/image-to-video`: Convert images to videos
- `/text_to_sfx`: Generate sound effects and music

#### Voice Agent Features
- `/createvoice`: Initialize voice chat
- `/talk`: Begin voice interaction
- `/leave`: Exit voice chat

## Usage Guidelines

### Text and Vision Models

1. Select your model with `/model`
2. Set an optional system prompt plus optional parameterized settings and enter the private thread
3. Enter your prompt or upload media
4. Wait for the model's response

### Media Generation

#### Image Generation
- Maximum prompt length: 1024 characters
- Pre-prompting supported by models: Claude, Llama, and specialized image models

#### Video Generation
- Maximum prompt length: 512 characters
- Image-to-video requirements:
  - Resolution: 1280x720
  - Format: JPEG or PNG (non-transparent)
  - Compression recommended

### Best Practices

- For media generation, pre-prompt multimodal models with context and specific details
- Use system prompts to guide the model's behavior
- Invite additional users to private threads using the @ symbol within the private thread
- Image generation is parameterized by the model's input requirements and guidelines, including character limits. 
- Use the image generator's parameters such as resolution, image count, prompt strength, and other model-specific parameters to optimize the output.

- Keep track of your active threads in `#⁠model-chat`
- Reference help commands for detailed guidance:
  - `/model_help`: Text model assistance
  - `/media_help`: Media generation help
  - `/audio_help`: Audio feature support

## Getting Help

If you need assistance:
- Contact `@StreamPod AI` via DM
- Ask questions in `#⁠general-support`
- Use the appropriate help commands for specific features
- email us at support@streampod.ai

## Advanced Tips

- Use the channel menu to track private threads (indicated by a blinking dot)
- Access thread names through the context menu (right-click)
- For video understanding tasks, specifically use Nova Lite or Nova Pro models
- Remember that all video and image generation requests are processed in a queue system and include workflow analytics.  
- Use `/leave` to properly end voice chat sessions and avoid unnecessary resource consumption
- Models might refuse to process requests if the prompt exceeds the character limit or if the model is busy processing other requests
- Models might refuse to process requests if the prompt does not follow the model's input requirements and guidelines
